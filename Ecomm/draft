1. Folder Structure
Organize your project files to keep things clean and manageable:
/ecommerce_project
│
├── /static
│   ├── /css         # Stylesheets for your pages
│   ├── /js          # JavaScript files (optional for frontend interactions)
│   ├── /images      # Any images used in your project
│
├── /templates
│   ├── index.html   # Homepage for your e-commerce site
│   ├── buyer.html   # Dashboard for buyers
│   ├── seller.html  # Dashboard for sellers
│   ├── admin.html   # Dashboard for admin
│
├── app.py           # Backend Python script (using Flask)
├── requirements.txt # File for Python dependencies (libraries)
└── database.db      # SQLite database (or connect to another DB later)



2. Frontend (HTML/CSS)
- Use HTML templates for pages like:- Homepage: Display products.
- Buyer Dashboard: Cart and order history.
- Seller Dashboard: Inventory and sales.
- Admin Dashboard: User management.

- Enhance styling with CSS files in the /static folder.~~~


3. Backend (Python)
- Use Flask (lightweight) or Django (feature-rich) for the backend.
- Backend functionality:- Routes (URLs): Map URLs to specific pages (e.g., /home, /cart).
- APIs: Process login/signup, manage orders, etc.
- Database: Connect your Python app to the database.



4. Database Integration
- Use SQLite initially (easy for beginners).
- Use Python sqlite3 library (or SQLAlchemy for ORM) to handle database interactions.- Example: Fetching products, updating inventory, processing orders.



5. Next Steps
- Install necessary libraries. Run this in your terminal:pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy

- Start small: Create a login/signup page and test database connections.
- Gradually build features like product listing, cart management, and admin controls.
